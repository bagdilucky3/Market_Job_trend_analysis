# Market_job_trend_analysis-(Tech Japan  Autumn Data Analysis Hackathon 2023)

Problem Statement :
Imagine you are Mr. Shah, and this assignment has been passed over to you by the boss. You need to find a better and more effective way of mapping these insights. The following is a list of parameters you can use:
• Mapping down the IT industry trends over the last few years for Company X.
• Understanding which positions will be in demand in the future so that the talent procurement for those positions can be done beforehand.
• Creating a generalised organisational structure chart for company X to understand the recent changes company X has undergone. 
• A writeup mentioning the process, data collection methods, insights and key findings.

Company X Characteristics :
Below are the characteristics or the parameters for choosing the Company X (the company can be chosen by the participants)
• It needs to be a late series company, a post IPO company which has successfully grown over the past few years so that it can be taken as an example. 
• It should have an IT tech product and should be in a similar industry so that trends can be mapped down.

My approch to solve the problem: 
The problem is given in four parts. I tried to solve them one by one. But before it, I selected DigitalOcean as Company “X” because I think it’s the perfect match for the given description as it is an IT company that went public recently in 2021 & growing at an amazing rate.
Out of four, the first problem was about understanding the trends in tech. So, a few trends are quite obvious like AI or Blockchain. But to understand market forecasting I read reports from Gartner, Precedence Research, Statista, etc.
Then I tried a different approach to understand the trends. I called it “Developers Perspective”. Here I analyzed Developer surveys by stack overflow, and the Developer Nation community to understand how new tech and trends are affecting developers. After collecting data in Excel from different resources I used Tableau to visualize it.
The second problem was about understanding the job market. So again I read different resources like WEF Future of Jobs, DigitalOcean reports, etc to understand it. After reading and collecting the data again I visualize it with the help of Tableau.
The third problem was about recent changes the company has undergone for this I read a lot about DigitalOcean workflow, annual reports, Earning presentations, Current reports, Release notes, etc. After reading all of them thoroughly I created a timeline for recent changes & a chart of the team leaders.
